# Task 8 — Verify Idempotency

## Goal

Run the playbook again and confirm that it does not make unnecessary changes.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 8 — Second playbook run showing the play recap with `changed=0`, `unreachable=0`, and `failed=0` for both web servers

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT3-SS8.png)

# Task 9 — Test Both Websites Manually

## Goal

Confirm that the static website is accessible from both public IP addresses.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 9 — `curl -I` output showing HTTP `200 OK` from both servers

# Assignment Questions

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What issue did you face while completing this assignment, and how did you fix it?**

Playbook Variable Scoping & Execution Issue: During the final playbook task to verify the website's HTTP 200 status, I encountered an "undefined variable" error for ansible_host. This occurred because the play was targeting localhost, which doesn't natively possess the inventory variables of the web servers.
 
 Fix: I refactored the site.yml playbook to target the web group directly instead of localhost. By utilizing the inventory_hostname variable within the uri module, Ansible successfully iterated through the actual web servers. This also ensured the playbook was fully idempotent, reporting zero unintended changes on subsequent runs.

---

**2. What did you learn from this assignment?**

I learned how to use a multi-play Ansible playbook to manage multiple servers from one controller. I also learned how to install Nginx, deploy website files, use handlers, verify HTTP responses, and test idempotency.

---

**3. Why is it useful to split installation, deployment, and verification into separate plays?**

Separating the responsibilities makes the playbook easier to understand, troubleshoot, maintain, and reuse. Each play has a specific purpose instead of combining every operation into one section..

---

**4. What is one benefit of using the Ansible `copy` module instead of cloning the website directly from Git on every managed server?**

The copy module allows the controller to distribute the same approved website file consistently to every managed server. Ansible also detects whether the destination file has changed before copying it again.

---

**5. What does idempotency mean in this assignment?**

Idempotency means that running the same playbook repeatedly produces the required state without making unnecessary changes. On the second run, the web servers should normally show changed=0.

---

**6. What does the Ansible `uri` module verify in Play 3?**

The uri module sends HTTP requests from the Ansible controller to both web servers and verifies that each website responds with the expected HTTP status code 200.
