# Assignment 3 — Automate React App Deployment Using Azure DevOps CI/CD

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will create a multi-stage Azure DevOps pipeline that builds, tests, publishes, and deploys a React application to an Ubuntu VM hosted on AWS or Azure. The pipeline will automatically run when changes are committed to `main`, transfer the production build as an artifact, and deploy it through Nginx.

---

# Task 0 — Verify the Starting Environment

## Goal

Confirm that Azure DevOps, the pipeline agent, Terraform, Ansible, and the selected cloud environment are ready.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 1 — Import and Personalize the React Application

## Goal

Import the React application into Azure Repos and add your Full Name and the current date.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 1 — Imported React Project in Azure Repos

Add a screenshot of Azure Repos showing:

* Imported React project
* Repository name
* `main` branch
* Project files

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Provision and Configure the Target VM

## Goal

Provision an Ubuntu VM using Terraform and configure Nginx, React SPA routing, SSH access, and deployment permissions using Ansible.

No separate submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 3 — Create or Update the SSH Service Connection

## Goal

Create or update an Azure DevOps SSH Service Connection that allows the pipeline to connect securely to the target VM.

No separate submission screenshot is required for this task.

> Do not include the VM password, SSH private key, token, or another secret in the submission.

# Task 4 — Author the Multi-Stage Azure Pipeline

## Goal

Create an Azure Pipeline containing Build, Test, Publish, and Deploy stages with an automatic trigger for commits to `main`.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 2 — Multi-Stage Pipeline YAML

Add a screenshot of the Azure Pipeline YAML open in the editor showing:

* Trigger
* Build stage
* Test stage
* Publish stage
* Deploy stage

Add your screenshot here.

> Do not expose passwords, private keys, tokens, or cloud credentials.

---

# Task 5 — Run the Pipeline and Resolve Configuration Issues

## Goal

Complete a successful end-to-end pipeline run containing all four stages.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 3 — Successful Multi-Stage Pipeline Run

Add a screenshot of one Azure DevOps pipeline run showing all four stages succeeded:

* Build
* Test
* Publish
* Deploy

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Verify the Deployment on the VM

## Goal

Confirm that the pipeline deployed the production-ready React files to the correct Nginx web root.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 4 — Post-Deployment Contents of /var/www/html

Add a screenshot of the pipeline SSH verification log or VM terminal showing the post-deployment contents of:

`/var/www/html`

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 7 — Verify the Website and Automatic Trigger

## Goal

Confirm that the React application is accessible and that a commit to `main` automatically triggers the CI/CD pipeline.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 5 — Deployed React Application

Add a browser screenshot showing:

* Deployed React application
* VM public IP address in the browser address bar
* Your Full Name
* Deployment date

Add your screenshot here.

## Final Application URL

`http://<vm-public-ip>`

Replace the placeholder and paste your final application URL below:

http://32.196.137.183/

# CI/CD Workflow Summary

Write a short explanation of the CI/CD workflow you created.

I implemented a multi-stage Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, testing, artifact publishing, and deployment of a React application. The pipeline is automatically triggered by changes committed to the main branch. During the Build stage, the required Node.js environment and dependencies are prepared and the React production build is generated. The Test stage executes the application's tests before deployment can continue.

The production build is transferred between stages using Azure DevOps Pipeline Artifacts. During the Publish stage, the deployment artifact is verified and published for use by the Deploy stage. The Deploy stage downloads the artifact and uses an Azure DevOps SSH Service Connection to securely transfer the compiled React files to /var/www/html on the Ubuntu VM.

Nginx serves the deployed React application from the VM, with SPA routing configured through Ansible. The deployment is verified by confirming that index.html and the compiled assets exist in /var/www/html, Nginx is active, and the application responds successfully over HTTP. This workflow provides an automated CI/CD process from a commit to main through production deployment.
