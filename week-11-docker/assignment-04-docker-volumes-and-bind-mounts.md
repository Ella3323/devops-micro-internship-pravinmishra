# Assignment 4 — Docker Volumes and Bind Mounts

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Docker Bind Mounts and Docker Volumes to persist logs and application data outside a container’s lifecycle. You will verify that data remains available after containers are removed and recreated.

---

# Task 1 — Persist Nginx Logs Using a Bind Mount

## Goal

Deploy an Nginx container with a Bind Mount and verify that its log files remain on the VM host after the container is removed.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Nginx Image Pull

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker pull nginx:alpine
```

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Host Log Directory

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the created host directory:

```text
$HOME/nginx-logs
```

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS2.png)

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Running Nginx Container with Port Mapping

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the `myweb` container with:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Nginx Welcome Page

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page at:

```text
http://<YOUR-VM-PUBLIC-IP>
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Bind-Mounted Log Files

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the host log files and access-log content from:

```text
$HOME/nginx-logs
```

The output must show `access.log`, `error.log`, and an access-log entry created when you opened the Nginx page.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Nginx Container Removed

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker stop myweb
docker rm myweb
```

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS6.png)

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Logs Persist After Container Removal

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing that `access.log` and `error.log` still exist in:

```text
$HOME/nginx-logs
```

The access log must retain its content after the container has been removed.

# Task 2 — Share Persistent Data Using a Docker Volume

## Goal

Deploy backend and frontend containers that share data through a named Docker Volume. Verify that the data remains after both containers are removed and recreated.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Project File Structure

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the `two-tier-app` project structure, including separate `backend` and `frontend` directories with a `Dockerfile` and `index.js` file in each.

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS8.png)

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Custom Docker Network

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing `mynetwork` in:

```bash
docker network ls
```

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS9.png)

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Docker Volume

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing `shared-data` in:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS10.png)

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Backend Dockerfile

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the completed backend `Dockerfile`.

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS11.png)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Backend Image Build

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of the `backend-app:latest` image build.

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS12.png)

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Running Backend Container

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the running `backend` container.

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS13.png)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Frontend Dockerfile

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the completed frontend `Dockerfile`.

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS14.png)

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Frontend Image Build

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of the `frontend-app:latest` image build.

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS15.png)

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Running Backend and Frontend Containers

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show both `backend` and `frontend` containers running. Only `frontend` must have the published port mapping:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS1.png)

---

#### Screenshot 17 — Backend Write Operation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing a successful backend write operation to the shared Docker Volume.

The output must include:

```text
Data written: Hello from Backend!
```

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS17.png)

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Frontend Reads Shared Data

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Hello from Backend!
```

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS18.png)

---

#### Screenshot 19 — First Shared-Data Update

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Test Data 1
```

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS19.png)

---

#### Screenshot 20 — Second Shared-Data Update

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Test Data 2 - New Update
```

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS20.png)

---

#### Screenshot 21 — Container Removal and Recreation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the `frontend` and `backend` containers removed and recreated using the same `shared-data` Docker Volume.

![alt text](screenshots/ASSIGNMENT-04-SS21.png)

---

#### Screenshot 22 — Data Persists After Recreation

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Test Data 2 - New Update
```

This proves that the `shared-data` Docker Volume outlived both application containers.

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

# Storage Persistence Notes

Write a short explanation covering:

- The difference between a Bind Mount and a Docker Volume
- How Task 1 proved Bind Mount persistence
- How Task 2 proved Docker Volume persistence
- Why Docker Volumes are commonly used for application data

The difference between a Bind Mount and a Docker Volume
A bind mount links a specific folder that I choose on the server to a folder inside the container. A Docker volume is storage that Docker creates and manages itself; I only refer to it by name. Both keep data outside the container. The difference is who controls the location: with a bind mount it’s me, and with a volume it’s Docker.

How Task 1 proved Bind Mount persistence
I linked the server folder ~/nginx-logs to Nginx’s log folder inside the container. When I visited the website, the visit was recorded in access.log, and that file appeared directly on the server. I then stopped and deleted the container. The log files were still on the server with the same entries, which proved the data didn’t depend on the container.

How Task 2 proved Docker Volume persistence
I created a volume called shared-data and attached it to two containers. The backend wrote a message into a file in the volume, and the frontend read the same file and displayed it in the browser. I updated the message twice, and each change appeared after a refresh. Finally, I deleted both containers and created new ones using the same volume. The browser still showed “Test Data 2 - New Update”, which proved the data outlived both containers.

Why Docker Volumes are commonly used for application data
Volumes are managed by Docker, so they don’t depend on a particular folder existing on the server, and they work the same way on any machine. They’re kept safe when containers are deleted, replaced or upgraded, and they can be shared between containers. That makes them the standard choice for data an app must not lose, such as databases, uploaded files and reports.
